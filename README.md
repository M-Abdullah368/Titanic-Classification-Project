# Titanic-Classification-Project
In this **Titanic Classification Project**, we began by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset to understand its structure and contents. We then handled missing values by filling or dropping columns as needed. Through **Exploratory Data Analysis**, we visualized data distributions and relationships, creating new features for better model accuracy. We encoded categorical variables, split the data into **Training** and **Testing** sets, and **Standardized** the features. A **Random Forest Classifier** was trained on the data, and its performance was evaluated using **accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix**. Additional visualizations were created to further explore and present the findings. This end-to-end process showcases a typical workflow for a data science classification problem, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
